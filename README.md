# google-lead-gen
This program uses selenium to get all the results as per entered query. It will take input from google sheets so you'll have enable api of google drive and
google sheets and then download the creds file and place it in the same directory of the project. 

You can enter as many queries in first column of the sheet. 1 query per 1 row. Queries like "bakeries near me, schools near me" or anything of this sort.
This selenium program will get the queries one by one and run whole program and will create the json file with same name as query with all the business
details against that query. 

If anyone faces any problems running through this code please reach out to me. I'll be happy to help.
